NAME

	SimpleCalendar 1.1 - A Simple Interface For Monthly Calendars

SYNOPSIS

	use SimpleCalendar;
	use Data::Dumper;
	
	my $obj = new SimpleCalendar(6, 2004, 'monday');
	my $cal = $obj->BuildCalendar();

DESCRIPTION

	This module provides a fairly simple interface for creating monthly
	calendars. It makes use of Time::Local module which is usually
	bundled with Perl by default.

METHODS

	 new
		Returns a new SimpleCalendar object. It takes three arguments: The month 
		( which ranges from 1 to 12 ), the year ( which must be a 4 digit number with
		no leading zeros ) and the start of the week ( from sunday to saturday ).


	BuildCalendar
		Returns an array reference which contains the calendar. Each element of this
		array represents a week and each element of a week is the day. Days that
		are before the first day of the month are assigned undef values as well as days
		that are after the last day of the month. For example, the structure
		that will be returned from the previous example is:

			$cal = [[undef,'1','2','3','4','5','6'],['7','8','9','10','11','12','13'],['14'
			,'15','16','17','18','19','20'],['21','22','23','24','25','26','27'],['28','29',
			'30',undef,undef,undef,undef]];


INSTALLATION

	Just download the file to whatever location you like and use it in
	your scripts.

BUGS

	Not known.
